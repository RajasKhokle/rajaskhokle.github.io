# Summary
I am a data scientist, academically trained researcher, and problem solver. I am passionate about data-driven decision making, and digital transformation. I have worked with corporate, government and academic clients and stakeholders and have experience in leading teams and managing projects with Agile project management practices. I manage end-to-end projects through extensive and structured documentation and deliver critical findings to the stakeholders through effective presentation and visualisation skills. I love drawing actionable insights from the data.

Attention to the details, ability to organise information, strong analytical and reasoning skills, Innovativeness, Quick learning ability, enquiring mind, excellent presentation and reporting skills.

# Projects & Experience

<ul>
    <li><strong>Prescription Drug Forecasting: </strong> Developed automated Time series forecasting models for diabetes drugs over 9000 practices in UK from 1.5 TB of data using PostgreSQL and Python. Created Tableau Dashboard for map and time series visualisations filtered by region and drug.</li>
    <li><strong>Predicting the built-up area of the real estate (Machine Vision) :</strong>- Using Image Processing and machine learning I have determined the built-up area of a home which can potentially save $20 Million for a real estate startup company.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Project on Fire Detection and Extinguishing:</strong> First, I captured an image of the floor from a camera, then if it detects fire in the frame, identifies the are of strongest fire and sends the co-ordinates to a robot that goes to the fire (but not get burnt -the model continuosly detected the edge of the fire) and extinguish it and come back to its base.</li>
    <li><strong>Automated Valuation Model for Real Estate:</strong>Achieved 80% model accuracy with 7% variation in predicting the housing prices using supervised learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Language Processing, Australian Job Market :</strong>In this project, I performed Job classification to understand the factors that influence data science jobs in Australia. Used web scraping to gather data, Regex for data cleaning and various regression and classification model to predict the job category and salary. </li>
    <li><strong>Reduction in Revision orthopedic Surgeries - A Regression model:</strong>â€¢	Performed Quantitative analyses of the data on Orthopaedic surgeries from around the world identifying that over 22% of wrist and ankle surgeries require revision as opposed to 10 % for hip and knee.Used Regression analysis and my knowledge of Electronics engineering to develop an orthopaedic diagnostic sensor to avoid the re-surgery that can potentially reduce over 70% of re-surgeries. This technology is patented.
</li>
    <li><strong>A new fractal geometry that makes devices smaller:</strong> I invented a new geometry - Christened M-Segment Quadratic Fractal - It can miniaturize the communication devices by as much as 48%. But that is not the main feature. The main feature is that it is a family of curves that can provide a designer a flexibility of choosing between the complexity, miniaturization and performance. </li>
